An add-on to the [Origins](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/origins) mod. Enables the Ravager origin.

> ### Ravager
>
> Ravagers are fierce creatures with incredible strength and durability. However, their size and intimidating reputation come with consequences.
>
> 游릭 **Ram:** You are able to give your attacks extreme knockback for a few seconds.  
> 游릭 **Illager:** Illager-aligned mobs will not attack you unless provoked.  
> 游릭 **Tough:** Your natural bulk gives you increased health (+4 hearts) and armor (+2 armor bars).
>
> 游리 **Giant:** You are 2.5 blocks tall.
>
> 游댮 **Four-Legged:** Your clumsy hands are unable to use more than one item at a time. You can't use any item in your offhand.  
> 游댮 **Enemy of the State:** Villagers refuse to trade with you, and naturally spawned Iron Golems will attack on sight.  
> 游댮 **Heavyweight:** You are too heavy to ride on any mobs or in boats and have reduced speed in water.
